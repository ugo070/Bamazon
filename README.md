# Bamazon

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and Sequelize. The
web app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

I have turned this homework in before but was returned as incomplete and i was directed by the instructor that i should not use inquirer to do this homework as i have submitted. I have gone to re-do the whole exercise using the npm sequelize-cli package,npx sequelize init:models & npx sequelize init:config,express,node and axios packages

Am at the final stage to complete this homework to get the functionalities of the App working but due to time line to submit and focus on my final project i have to turn this in and will still get the functionalities working after our final project presentation.

thanks
